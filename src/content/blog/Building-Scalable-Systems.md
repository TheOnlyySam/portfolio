# Building Scalable Systems

> Scaling isn't adding servers — it's adding architecture.

## Introduction

Scaling software systems is one of the most complex challenges in technology.
Most companies believe scaling means adding servers or increasing database capacity.
That is only a small piece of the puzzle.

Real scalability comes from:

- Architectural decisions
- Developer culture
- Infrastructure planning
- Monitoring & Observability


## Why Systems Fail To Scale


### 1. Poor API Design

Bad APIs lead to:

- Data inconsistencies
- Tight coupling
- Fragile services

Solution:
Design APIs around clear business domains — focus on stability over flexibility.


### 2. Monolithic Database Bottlenecks

Monoliths are fine — until they aren’t.

Signs you need to split:

- Slow queries affecting unrelated systems
- Increasing deadlocks
- Cross-service joins

Solution:
Introduce database per service gradually.
Move heavy read operations to caching layers.


## DevOps Lessons

> "A system is only as reliable as its weakest dependency."


### Continuous Integration & Delivery

Without CI/CD:

- Releases are painful
- Hotfixes are risky
- Developers fear shipping

Solution:

- Git-based pipelines
- Automated tests
- Staging environments


### Monitoring Everything

Every production system needs:

- Metrics
- Logs
- Traces

Good tools:

- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Loki
- ELK Stack


## Infrastructure Patterns


### Horizontal Scaling vs Vertical Scaling
